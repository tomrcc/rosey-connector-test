      content: Be aware of what's normal for your target customers' inboxes. If you're
        sending out emails to people who are on Gmail and Yahoo accounts, then
        there's little chance they'll get blocked because their addresses
        haven't been flagged as spam yet. But if you're reaching out to people
        with Outlook or AOL addresses, there's a good chance your message will
        get flagged as junk mail and end up in their spam folder before they
        ever see it. Make sure you're testing different types of addresses
        before sending out any mass marketing campaigns.

        the subscription form asking if they'd like to receive marketing
        communications from you in the future.

        email certification services. This ensures that your emails will be
        accepted by the major ISPs. An ESP that offers multiple IP addresses, or
        one that allows you to use your own IP address if necessary. ISPs often
        block messages from unknown senders, so having your own IP address helps
        get around this issue.

        the recipient must have previously agreed to receive emails from you
        before they can see content in their inboxes or on their mobile devices.
        This helps prevent people from signing up for newsletters they don't
        want and can help protect against spam complaints from users who didn't
        know they had signed up for something in the first place.
